Welcome to Unstlyed, a component hub containing a handful of components to help you get started with building your own component library.

I initially started this project after finding myself creating the same core components for various side projects. I wanted to build myself a component library that I could
just grab from and customize as I needed.

"Well why not just use one of the many, _many_ libraries currently out there?" you may ask. And to that I say, valid point. Really I wanted a library that was simple and customizable...
and I just wanted to build my own library (Its a great learning process!). With that, I created Unstyled. The idea at first was just components that had all the accessibility requirements
needed and no styling, hence the name Unstyled, but as I was building I couldn't help but add a few base styles using CSS modules (for peak flexibility).

I am considering Unstyled to be in **BETA** at the moment as I am currently testing it across various projects and I'm actively working to add new components and features.

If you are curious, here is a list of some of the components and features coming soon:

- Accessibility audit of current components
- Updated Dialog with animations
- Calendar/DatePicker
- Table
- Sheets
- Snackbars
- CLI tool for automating setup

**Can I use Unstyled in my project?**

Of course! Just please note this is an evolving project _but_ for the most part, the current components most likely won't have breaking changes anytime soon.
